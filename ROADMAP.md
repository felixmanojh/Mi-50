# Mi-50 Production Readiness Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements and best practices to transform Mi-50 from a prototype into a production-ready game, focusing on a kid-friendly, single-screen, turn-based experience. Each item's status will be updated as development progresses.

## 1. Code Quality & Maintainability

-   **Implement Linting & Formatting:**
    -   **Description:** Set up ESLint for code quality checks and Prettier for consistent code formatting across the project.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Enable Strict TypeScript:**
    -   **Description:** Configure `tsconfig.json` for stricter type checking to catch more errors at compile time.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Refine Component Architecture:**
    -   **Description:** Review and refactor React components to ensure they are small, focused, reusable, and follow clear separation of concerns.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Review State Management:**
    -   **Description:** Assess current state management (React hooks) and consider if a more structured approach (e.g., `useReducer`, Context API, or a lightweight library) is needed for growing complexity.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Implement Robust Error Handling:**
    -   **Description:** Add React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle UI errors and explore client-side error logging for production.
    -   **Status:** TBD

## 2. Performance & Optimization

-   **Optimize Asset Sizes:**
    -   **Description:** Compress all image (PNG, JPG) and audio (MP3) files to reduce bundle size and improve loading times.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Analyze Bundle Size:**
    -   **Description:** Use build tools to analyze the JavaScript bundle size and identify opportunities for optimization or lazy loading.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Optimize Animations:**
    -   **Description:** Ensure all animations use performant CSS properties (transforms, opacity) to maintain 60fps smoothness.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Implement Lazy Loading:**
    -   **Description:** Lazy load components or game phases that are not critical for initial render to improve perceived load time.
    -   **Status:** TBD

## 3. User Experience (UX) & User Interface (UI)

-   **Enhance Visual Polish & Animations:**
    -   **Description:** Improve existing animations (dice roll, player movement) and add new visual effects for special squares and game events.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Implement Comprehensive Sound Design:**
    -   **Description:** Add sound effects for all key game interactions (dice roll, moves, special squares, trivia, win/lose) and ensure background music is well-integrated with volume controls.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Improve Accessibility:**
    -   **Description:** Ensure good color contrast, readable fonts, and clear visual indicators for all game elements, especially for current player and game state.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Refine Intuitive Feedback:**
    -   **Description:** Ensure every player action and game event provides clear, immediate visual and auditory feedback.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Optimize for Single-Screen Local Play:**
    -   **Description:** Design UI elements (buttons, player indicators) to be large and easily distinguishable for multiple players sharing a single screen.
    -   **Status:** TBD

## 4. Game Design & Mechanics (Refinement)

-   **Conduct Playtesting & Balancing:**
    -   **Description:** Organize playtesting sessions with the target age group to identify and address any balancing issues with special squares or game flow.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Enhance Replayability:**
    -   **Description:** Explore options for increasing replay value, such as expanding trivia question pool or introducing minor game variations.
    -   **Status:** TBD

## 5. Deployment & Operations

-   **Integrate Basic Analytics:**
    -   **Description:** Set up privacy-friendly analytics to gather anonymous usage data (e.g., games played, average duration).
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Draft Privacy Policy:**
    -   **Description:** Create a clear and concise privacy policy, especially important for a game targeting children.
    -   **Status:** TBD

## 6. Documentation (Internal & External)

-   **Develop Internal Developer Documentation:**
    -   **Description:** Add TSDoc/JSDoc comments to complex functions and components, and document architectural decisions.
    -   **Status:** TBD

-   **Create In-Game "How to Play" Guide:**
    -   **Description:** Implement a simple, clear guide within the game itself to explain rules and mechanics to new players.
    -   **Status:** TBD
